### Having a life with purpose

I believe my life has a purpose. And that purpose for me is Love.

I believe that we are not the authors of Love, but Love is has authored us. And as much as we are willing to receive it (God/Love) we will also be able to give it into others.

None of us is perfect and we all have made wrong, but there's so much in life than only our past. Learn, change, adapt, become a better person every single day.

So, having a purpose in life, for me, means having the  willingness to be transformed by Love and be able to give it for others.

### Contact

- [open a discussion](https://github.com/vic/vic/discussions) if you want to have an open conversation about anything. I'd love to hear about you.
- vborja@apache.org, for business and spam.
- [oeiuwq@x](https://x.com/oeiuwq)
- [oeiuwq@bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/oeiuwq.bsky.social)

### I'm always open to remote opportunities

I love to work on developer tools, compilers, effect systems, or nix-infra tooling.

Nowadays I prefer doing Nix, Elm, Scala3, Rust and Go.

[Here's my CV](https://github.com/vic/vic/blob/main/cv.md) 


Feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or discuss opportunities or just talk about common interests or projects.

If you like what [I'm doing](https://github.com/search?q=involves%3Avic&type=pullrequests) and want to show your support, I'm open to [donations](https://ko-fi.com/E1E51I0QG5).

You can also just say "Hey, here's a potato" and leave [a potato](https://github.com/vic/vic/issues/new?title=Here%27s%20a%20potato) or anything else.

If you want me to contribute to some project I can also take [comissions](https://ko-fi.com/c/7a273262aa) for working on OpenSource.

## About me

I love poetry, Rothko paintings, the [Rebecca purple](https://github.com/vic/rebecca-theme) color and effect systems.

I'm a Seventh Day Adventist. I enjoy our [Sabbath School](https://sabbath-school.adventech.io/en) so much, self-reflecting, learning lessons from the Bible that can teach me about the real character of God and the love he gives us for us to give.

I also enjoy reading about Religions, Theology, Physics, Math (mainly related to C.S), Type Theory and Effect Systems.

I have a ~50% hearing disability. So I pretty much prefer to communicate via async written form whenever possible.

I love customizing my Glove80 Keyboard, and layout optimizations that can reduce finger stress.

I'm doing lots of Nix, Scala3, Go and Rust. And love creating stuff for people like me: nerds.

## OpenSource Mission

Everything I know, I've learned by reading others code. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge.

I create tools and languages that empower developers by making their work more productive, reliable, and enjoyable.  

My passion is building robust, real-world solutions with functional programming, effect systems, and language implementation.

## Skills

- Functional programming (Scala, Haskell, Elm, Elixir)
- Effect systems and concurrency models
- Compiler and language implementation (Scala, Rust, Go, Ruby, Python)
- Nix and reproducible developer tooling
- Open source leadership and community building

## Things I enjoy doing:

I love working in the following areas:
- Compiler and language implementation
- Effect systems research and development
- Developer tooling and infrastructure
- Functional programming projects

If you’re building something in these areas, let’s connect!
